// Checks the ancestor pass against an independent statement of what it is supposed to return, over
// randomly shaped trees.
//
// It exists because the pass memoises its answer for a folder and shares it with every folder below,
// which is a real optimisation over a real property (the answer is a union along the chain, and each
// folder's chain is a suffix of its children's) -- but a sharing bug there does not fail loudly. It
// hides results: a file that should have matched is silently dropped, and only for queries that reach
// this pass at all, which is the subset a user is least likely to notice or report.
//
// The reference below is written from the rule, not from the implementation. Deriving it by turning the
// memo off would share every helper with the thing under test, so any mistake inside those helpers
// would agree with itself and pass.
