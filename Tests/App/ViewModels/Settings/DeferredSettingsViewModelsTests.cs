// of it anyway -- which is what made every tab feel sluggish from the start, not just the first.
//
// The three deferred ones each do real work in their constructors (file reads / theme resource loading), so
// these pin that deferral, and -- the part that is easy to break silently -- that nothing on a recurring
// path reaches through the property and constructs one anyway.
