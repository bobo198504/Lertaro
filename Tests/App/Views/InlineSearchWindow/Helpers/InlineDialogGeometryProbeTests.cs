// The card is placed on the WPF thread, and asking a dialog's adapter from there is how a closing WPS dialog
// once froze the whole application: its answer comes through UI Automation, a synchronous call into a foreign
// process that stops answering when that process is busy or tearing the window down -- and waiting for the
// element in the first place is not what UI Automation's timeout bounds. So the probe must never measure on
// the thread that asks, must ask once per dialog layout instead of once per placement pass, and must not act
// on an answer that arrived for a layout the card has already left.
