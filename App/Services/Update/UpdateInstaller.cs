// Downloads and signature-verifies a portable-zip update, then hands it to the background service to

// domain (crypto/filesystem/service IPC) than the periodic GitHub version check.
//
// This process no longer performs the installation itself, and that is the whole point. It runs as the
// invoker, so writing into Program Files had to be paid for with a runas verb -- a UAC prompt on an update
// path named "silent", and a second one when the script it launched checked for elevation and asked again.
// The service is already LocalSystem and the App is already allowed to reach it without elevation, so the
// elevated half lives there and this half stops at the download.
