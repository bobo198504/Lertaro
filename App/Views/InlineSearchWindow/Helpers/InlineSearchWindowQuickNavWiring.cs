            // force-foregrounds a helper window as its very first move, which reads oddly from right
            // inside this click's own MouseLeftButtonUp handler).
            //
            // Restoring the dialog's own focus FIRST matters for a reason that isn't about this popup at
            // all: picking an item calls StandardFileDialogAdapter.NavigateTo, which sets the target path
            // but only actually confirms it (Enter + click into the address edit) if the dialog is back to
            // being the real foreground window ~300ms later (see that adapter's own isAllowed check) -- a
            // safety gate against confirming navigation on the wrong window if focus drifted elsewhere
            // during that wait. When this menu is triggered from inside the dialog itself (the existing
            // middle-click path), the dialog never lost foreground in the first place, so that gate is
            // always satisfied. Triggered from THIS window's own logo, the dialog had already lost
            // foreground to this window before the click even happened.
            //
            // ResetInlineSearchAndFocusDialog is the SAME mechanism Escape already uses to hand focus back
            // to the dialog without closing this window (grants the elevated Hook service one-shot
            // permission to call SetForegroundWindow past the system's foreground-lock, then asks it to).
            // Closing this window outright was tried first and made the popup vanish immediately instead:
            // whatever WPF/Win32 teardown a Window.Close() kicks off wasn't done by the time Show() went to
            // foreground its own helper window a moment later, and the new popup's Deactivated handler read
            // that as a click-away and closed it. Leaving this window open and just handing focus off does
            // not have that race -- but ResetInlineSearchAndFocusDialog's own SetForegroundWindow call
            // ALSO doesn't complete synchronously with the IPC call that requested it (round-trips to the
            // elevated Hook process): calling Show() right after via a single BeginInvoke hop was a coin
            // flip between "the dialog reclaimed foreground before Show() ran, so the popup was unaffected"
            // and "the dialog's foreground change lands AFTER Show()'s popup already opened, deactivating
            // it exactly like a real click-away would." Polling GetForegroundWindow() for real confirmation
            // first (the same pattern QuickSearchWindowController.FocusSearchBoxWhenForeground already
            // uses for the identical async-foreground-change problem) removes that race instead of hoping
            // one dispatcher hop is enough of a head start.
