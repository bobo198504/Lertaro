    // height frame slip through in real frame-level diagnostics, so this needs to sit above it -- but

    // results update now competed directly with the NEXT keystroke's own dispatch, which is what made
    // typing feel laggy. Normal sits between the two: still higher than Render (should still win the race
    // against that same paint), but no longer contends with Send-tier input processing. Needs the same
