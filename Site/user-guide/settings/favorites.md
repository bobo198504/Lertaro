# Favorites

Favorites allows you to pin frequently accessed folders, files, scripts, or web URLs with custom display names and top search priority. The settings page is located at **Settings → Favorites**.

## 1. Adding Favorite Items

Using the form at the top:

- **Display Name**: Optional custom alias. If left empty and the target is a local path, Lertaro automatically uses the target folder or filename.
- **Target Path**: Accepts absolute local file/directory paths, environment variables such as `%USERPROFILE%`, Windows Shell virtual paths such as `shell:Downloads`, or full URLs starting with `http://` / `https://`.
- **Browse Picker**: Click **Browse Folder** or **Browse File** to open native selection dialogs.
- **Add**: Click **Add** once a valid path is entered to save the item.

## 2. Managing List & Drag-and-Drop Ordering

The list below displays all saved favorites with granular management controls:

- **Six-Dot Drag Handle**: Every row includes a six-dot drag handle on the left to reorder items via drag-and-drop. You can also use the **Move Up** / **Move Down** buttons. The sequence here directly determines their ranking in search results and Quick Navigation menus.
- **Edit Item**: Turns the selected row into an inline editor. Save or cancel directly in that row; the top add form is not reused.
- **Delete Item**: Safely removes the entry from Favorites.
- **Clear list**: When the list is non-empty, the button beside the list heading removes all favorites at once; it is hidden when the list is empty.

You can also add a single existing file or folder directly from the search result action menu. Lertaro asks for the display name, and hides this action when the same path is already in Favorites.

## 3. Search Recall & Visual Appearance

- **Starred Star Badge (★)**: Matching favorite items display a prominent **★** badge beside their path in search results.
- **Custom Alias Recall**: Assign memorable names to deeply nested paths (e.g. naming `D:\Workspace\2026\Q1\Financial\Summary.xlsx` as `Q1 Financials`). Searching for the alias recalls the item instantly.
- **Multi-surface Aggregation**: Favorites automatically sync to the [**Quick Navigation**](../hotkeys#3-quick-navigation-mouse-triggers) menu and the [**Quick Panel**](./quick-panel#4-plugin-tabs) Favorites tab.
