# General Settings

General Settings covers core application behaviors, search window dimensions and visual layouts, result type priority weights, and preview provider sequences. The page is divided into six top tabs: **System**, **Quick Search Window**, **Full Search Window**, **Preview Window**, **Quick Navigation**, and **Previews & Thumbnails**.

## 1. System

- **Start Lertaro on System Boot**: Automatically launches Lertaro upon Windows user login.
- **Check for Updates on Startup**: Automatically checks online for new releases whenever Lertaro starts.
- **Silent In-Place Updates**: Only available when "Check for Updates" is enabled. Downloads and installs updates silently in the background without pop-up interruptions.
- **Enable Hardware Acceleration**: Enabled by default. If your dual-GPU laptop (e.g. NVIDIA Advanced Optimus) fails to switch graphics cards because Lertaro is active, disable this to use software rendering. Requires restarting Lertaro.
- **Hide System Tray Icon**: Hides the icon from the Windows taskbar notification area. The logo inside the Quick Search bar continues to provide the full context menu, so access is never lost.
- **Enable Everything Compatibility Service (IPC)**: Emulates the standard Everything Win32 IPC protocol in the background. Third-party software (such as Directory Opus and Total Commander) can query Lertaro's in-memory index directly.
- **Enable Fuzzy Matching**: Enabled by default. When active, queries match non-contiguous character sequences. When disabled, queries require contiguous substring matches (see [**Search Syntax**](../search-syntax)). Takes effect immediately.
- **Query Token Delimiter**: Single-character text box (default `:`). Defines the leading character for suffix tokens (e.g. `:.pdf`, `:@doc`, `:[S]`).
- **Log Level**: Dropdown selecting Error / Warning / Info (default) / Debug, controlling log verbosity across all processes.
- **UI Language**: Selects the active display language across the entire application.

## 2. Quick Search Window

Fine-tunes the dimensions, layout, and priority rankings of the centered floating search bar:

### Search Bar Layout

- **Search Bar Width (Pixels)**: Range `300–1200px`, default `570px`.
- **Search Bar Height (Pixels)**: Range `45–120px`, default `60px`. This value proportionally scales result icon sizes, line heights, and typography for visual balance.
- **Show Clock in Search Box**: Replaces the placeholder text with current date and time when the search box is empty. The clock disappears as soon as you type.
- **Switch to Full Window on Second Hotkey Press**: When enabled, pressing the global summon hotkey while the Quick Window is already open transitions directly into the Full Window, carrying over your active query.
- **Lock Position**: Prevents dragging the search bar to avoid accidental displacement.
- **Automatically Fill Clipboard Text**: Disabled by default. When the Quick Search Window opens without pre-filled text, new non-empty clipboard text is used as the search query. Manual paste and other windows are unaffected.
- **Reset Layout Settings**: Restores all search bar layout properties to initial defaults.

### Result Type Priority & Trigger Characters

- **Priority Sorting List**: Drag or move items (Applications, System Settings, Files, Plugin Extensions) to adjust which types rank highest in search results.
- **Exclusive Single-Character Trigger**: Assign a dedicated character prefix (e.g. `;` for File Filters) to restrict searches exclusively to that type when typed at the start of a query.

## 3. Full Search Window

Configures default window geometry, columns, and sidebars for the main search window (`Ctrl+F`):

- **Window Width / Height (Pixels)**: Width range `640–2000px` (default `854px`), height range `400–1400px` (default `480px`).
- **Single Instance Only**: When enabled, invoking the Full Window focuses the existing instance instead of spawning duplicate windows.
- **Close on Hotkey Repeat**: Off by default, so pressing the global hotkey again cycles back to the Quick Search Window carrying the current query. When enabled, pressing it again while the Full Window has focus closes the window outright instead. A visible but unfocused Full Window is brought back to the front either way.
- **Reset Search Window Settings**: Reverts default dimensions to factory settings.
- **Result Table Column Order**: Customize the display order of columns (Name, Path, Date Modified, etc.) in the tabular view.
- **Sidebar Filter Order**: Reorder filter groups in the left sidebar; each category dynamically displays live matching item counts.
- **Action Menu Group Order**: Reorder action groups inside the context action menu (`Ctrl+O`).

## 4. Preview Window

- **Preview Window Width / Height (Pixels)**: Width range `250–900px`, height range `250–1200px`.
- **Reset Preview Settings**: Reverts the QuickLook preview window to standard default proportions, automatically constrained within visible screen bounds.

## 5. Quick Navigation

- **Provider Order**: Drag and reorder root categories in the Quick Navigation menu (Favorites, History, Open Folders, and third-party file manager bookmarks).

## 6. Previews & Thumbnails

- **File Preview Provider Order**: Adjust the execution sequence and fallback order for preview renderers (built-in media decoders vs. third-party QuickLook bridge).
- **Thumbnail Provider Order**: Adjust the resolution priority for file icon and thumbnail extraction providers.
