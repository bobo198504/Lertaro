# Indexing Management

The Indexing settings page controls indexing scopes, refresh schedules, and exclusion rules across local hard drives, network shares, WSL distributions, and standalone folders. Top tabs include: **Local Drives**, **Network Drives**, **WSL** (shown only when distributions are detected), **Folders**, and **Exclusions**.

## 1. Local Drives

- **Top Status Card**: Displays total indexed physical drives and item counts, with a global **Rebuild Index** button.
- **Drive Row Items**:
  - **Enable / Disable Checkbox**: Toggles indexing for each individual partition.
  - **Filesystem & Status**: Displays underlying filesystem (NTFS, ReFS, FAT32, exFAT), health state, and indexed count.
  - **Per-Drive Actions**: Individual **Rebuild** and **Remove** buttons; displays a dynamic **Stop** button during active scans.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: NTFS / ReFS volumes sync incrementally via Windows USN Change Journals; FAT32 / exFAT volumes monitor filesystem change events.
- **Uninterrupted Rebuilds**: While a drive is rebuilding, its existing index answers user queries until the new index completes and replaces it in one step. If interrupted, scanning resumes from the last checkpoint on the next launch.

## 2. Network Drives

- **Network Storage Support**: Lists all mapped Windows network drives (SMB / NAS).
- **Refresh Mode**: Network shares lack local USN journals and rely on scheduled polling:
  - **Manual** — Refreshes only when "Rebuild Index" is clicked.
  - **Every 15 Minutes** — Recommended for active collaborative shares.
  - **Hourly** — Balanced schedule.
  - **Daily** — Ideal for static archival storage.
- **Symlink Loop Protection**: Built-in cycle detection and ancestor stack algorithms automatically prevent infinite traversal caused by circular symbolic links or reparse points.

## 3. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Appears automatically whenever at least one WSL distribution is installed:

- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically recognizes Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, and other WSL distros.
- **Status & Schedules**: Identical status cards and Refresh Mode options (Manual / 15 Min / Hourly / Daily).
- **Zero-I/O Queries**: WSL searches read the in-memory tree directly without waking or blocking the Linux subsystem.

## 4. Folders

Use standalone folder indexing when you want to target specific working directories instead of entire volumes or NAS shares:

- **Multi-Select Addition**: Click **Add Folder** to open a native picker supporting `Ctrl` / `Shift` batch selection.
- **UNC Path Support**: Add network UNC share paths directly (e.g. `\\server\share\projects`).
- **Independent Schedules**: Each folder has its own toggle, item counter, and Refresh Mode dropdown.

## 5. Exclusions

Exclusion rules filter what search returns, and they also bound how far the walk descends for network storage, WSL, folder indexes and local FAT32/exFAT drives, where an excluded directory is never indexed. Local NTFS/ReFS drives are still walked in full, so on those a path such as `E:\` only hides its results. To stop indexing a local drive entirely, turn it off under **Local Drives** above. The rules are organized into three sub-tabs:

### Path Exclusions

- **Matching Logic**: Prefix matching against absolute physical paths.
- **Environment Variables**: Accepts `%ProgramData%`, `%APPDATA%`, or `D:\Cache`.

### Glob Rules

- **Syntax**:
  - `*`: Matches characters within a single folder level (e.g. `*.tmp`, `*.log`).
  - `**`: Matches recursively across subdirectories (e.g. `**/node_modules/**`, `**/bin/**`, `**/obj/**`).

### Regex Rules

- **Advanced Filtering**: Regular expression matching against paths and filenames (e.g. `^\.` for hidden dotfiles, `~\$` for temporary Office locks).

> [!TIP]
> Exclusions support both **single entry additions** and **batch editing**: click **Generate from List** to export rules to text, edit, and click **Apply to List** to update in bulk. Modified exclusion rules automatically trigger index filtering.
