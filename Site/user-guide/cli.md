# CLI Search (lff)

Lertaro includes a lightweight and highly efficient command-line companion named **`lff`** (Lertaro Fuzzy Finder) — an interactive fuzzy finder built specifically for terminal power users and shell scripts. It communicates via local named pipes with the running Lertaro App to reuse the in-memory index tree without rescanning drives.

## 1. Why Choose lff

- **Shared Index, Zero I/O Latency**: Unlike `fzf` or `find` that crawl disk sectors from scratch on every run, `lff` queries Lertaro's multimillion-item memory index tree in sub-milliseconds.
- **Identical Search Syntax**: Inherits Lertaro's fuzzy jump matching, Chinese pinyin aliases, and modifier operators (see [**Search Syntax**](./search-syntax)).
- **Fast Fail-Safe**: Automatically detects whether Lertaro App is running. If not, it prints a clear error message to `stderr` and exits immediately without hanging your terminal.

## 2. Installation & PATH Setup

`lff.exe` ships directly inside the Lertaro package:

- **Installer**: Check **Add lff CLI search tool to PATH** in the setup wizard to make `lff` accessible anywhere in your terminal.
- **Portable Edition**: Manually add the unzipped folder path to your user or system `PATH` environment variable.

> [!NOTE]
> After updating PATH, open a new terminal window for the change to take effect; existing shell sessions will not reflect environment changes automatically.

## 3. Interactive UI & Keybindings

Run `lff` in any terminal to open the full-screen interactive interface:

```bash
lff
```

### Keybindings Cheat Sheet

| Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type Characters** | Filters search results in real time with fuzzy jump matching. |
| `↑` / `↓` | Moves the highlight up / down. |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down` | Scrolls up / down by full page. |
| `←` / `→` | Moves the cursor horizontally within the search input bar. |
| `Tab` | Toggles selection/mark on the highlighted row (marked items display a `*` badge). |
| `Enter` | Outputs all marked paths (or the highlighted path if none marked) to `stdout` and exits. |
| `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` | Exits cleanly without outputting anything. |

## 4. Non-interactive Search

Use `--search` when a script needs search results without opening the interactive interface:

```bash
# Print up to 20 matching paths
lff --search "report"

# Sort the complete result set first, then keep the first 50 results
lff --search "report" --limit 50

# Restrict the search to files under a directory
lff --search "report" --files --path "D:\Documents"

# Restrict the search to folders
lff --search "report" --folders

# Print one compact JSON array with result metadata
lff --search "report" --json
```

The complete result set is sorted before `--limit` is applied. Without `--limit`, at most 20 results are printed. Plain output writes one path per line; `--json` writes one JSON array rather than NDJSON. Each JSON item includes the name, path, directory flag, drive, attributes, size, and creation, modification, and access timestamps. This mode uses the same search syntax as the interactive interface and requires the Lertaro App to be running.

`--files` and `--folders` cannot be used together. `--path` limits the search to the specified directory and its descendants.

## 5. Pre-filling Queries & Pipeline Input

You can provide an initial search term directly via command-line arguments or standard input:

```bash
# Via argument
lff report

# Via standard input pipeline
echo report | lff
```

Both open the interactive TUI pre-populated with `report` as the initial filter, allowing you to refine the search or press `Enter` directly to confirm.

## 6. Multi-selection & Batch Output

Press `Tab` to mark items. **Marked selections persist even when you change your search query**.

You can search for `doc` to mark several Word documents, clear the query, search `pdf` to mark several reports, and press `Enter` — `lff` outputs all marked paths across queries line-by-line to standard output.

## 7. Shell Scripting Examples

`lff` renders its TUI directly into the console buffer without polluting the standard output stream. Only the final confirmed path strings are written to `stdout`, making it ideal for piping into other tools:

### PowerShell Workflows

```powershell
# Open the selected file in VS Code
code (lff)

# Assign chosen directory to a variable and navigate to it
$target = lff; cd $target

# Pipe results as FileInfo objects down the pipeline
lff | Get-Item | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime
```

### CMD / Batch Workflows

```cmd
:: Process selected paths line-by-line in a for loop
for /f "delims=" %i in ('lff') do code "%i"
```

## 8. Limitations & Intentional Choices

- **Requires Foreground App**: `lff` relies on the running Lertaro App instance for querying; it does not perform standalone indexing.
- **No GUI Previews**: Optimized exclusively for fast terminal piping. For interactive media/rich text previews, use Lertaro's GUI [**Actions & Preview**](./actions-and-preview).
